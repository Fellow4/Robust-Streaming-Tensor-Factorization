# Robust-Streaming-Tensor-Factorization

This repository contains the code associated with the paper "Variational Bayesian Inference for Robust Streaming Tensor Factorization and Completion" to appear at IEEE ICDM 2018. Paper authors are [Cole Hawkins](https://colehawkins.github.io/) and [Zheng Zhang](https://engineering.ucsb.edu/people/zheng-zhang). For questions about this code, please contact Cole Hawkins.

Our contribution is contained in the file "streaming_bayesian_completion.m".

Our code requires the Matlab Tensor Toolbox:
